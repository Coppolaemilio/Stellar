# THIS PROJECT IS NO LONGER SUPPORTED
A lot of things happened since I started this project and I don't really use pygame any more. Also, new programs like [Atom](https://atom.io/) or [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)  made this IDE obsolete. I think that a set of Atom plugins will make more sense than coding the whole thing all over again. But after testing other engines/frameworks I do not recommend making games with Python due to its poor performance. Thanks to everyone that contributed and supported the project, it was a great experience for me.
See you around!

## About
Stellar is an open-source IDE for <b>game</b> development using Python.<br/> 
The goal is to have a program to design your own games using easy-to-learn and different easy tools for beginners and professionals.<br/>
You are free to distribute the games you create with <b>Stellar</b> in any way you like. You can even sell them.<br/>
This of course assumes that the sprites, images, and sounds you use can be distributed or sold as well.

`$ sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-qt4 pygame`

On OSX you can install PyQt4 with homebrew:<br>
`$ brew install qt`<br>
`$ brew install sip`<br>
`$ brew install pyqt`<br>
if this doesn't work you can follow this [tutorial](http://www.noktec.be/python/how-to-install-pyqt4-on-osx)

On Windows based:<br>
Download and install the dependencies listed above. Be sure to install the Python 2.x versions, not Python 3 versions.

## Running
To run Stellar (Windows/Ubuntu/OSX), from your command line go to (`cd`) into the Stellar folder, and then run:<br>
